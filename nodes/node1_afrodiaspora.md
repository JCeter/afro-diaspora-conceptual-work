# Node 1: Afro-Diasporic Belonging
## 1. Conceptual Definition
Afro-diasporic identity arises from shared historical subjugation, ancestral lineage, and transcontinental self-articulation.

## 2. Ontological Placement
Belonging is a mode of being, situated in relation to Earth, history, and collective memory, marking limits of intelligibility without reducing actors to monolithic categories.

## 3. Phenomenological Dimension
It is experienced as both rooted and relational, negotiating ancestral memory and contemporary identity.

## 4. Hermeneutic / Linguistic Dimension
Naming conventions (Afro-American, Afro-Brazilian, Afro-Colombian) perform world-disclosive acts, rendering a transnational community visible while respecting historical specificity.

## 5. Historical / Contextual Grounding
Grounded in the Afro-diasporic experience across the Americas, with attention to the legacy of Buenaventura music, culture, and migration.

## 6. Internal Stress-Test
Consistent with ontology, phenomenology, and hermeneutics of conceptual nodes.

## 7. External Stress-Test
Aligns with scholarship on African Diaspora, Postcolonial Theory, and cultural studies.
